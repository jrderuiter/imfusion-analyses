Introduction
------------

This repository accompanies the paper *"Identifying transposon insertions and
their effects from RNA-sequencing data"*, which describes a method for
identifying transposon insertion sites in insertional mutagenesis screens using
single- and paired-end RNA-sequencing data.

Here we provide the files and code needed to reproduce the computational
analyses performed in the paper.
