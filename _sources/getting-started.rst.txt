Setting up the environment
==========================

We use conda to ensure to create an isolated environment containing all of the
Python packages and external tools needed for the analyses. To create the conda
environment used for our analyses, run the following command from the root
directory:

.. code:: bash

    make env

This should create the minimum environment needed to run the notebooks. This
environment can be activated and used to run the notebooks as follows:

.. code:: bash

    source activate imfusion
    jupyter notebook


Generating the datasets
=======================

**This information will be added soon.**
