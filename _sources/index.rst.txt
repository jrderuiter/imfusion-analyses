This repository accompanies the paper *"Identifying transposon insertions and
their effects from RNA-sequencing data"*, which describes a method for
identifying transposon insertion sites in insertional mutagenesis screens using
single- and paired-end RNA-sequencing data.

The repository_ provides the files and code needed to reproduce the
computational analyses used in the paper. For an overview of how to setup
the used environment and download/generate the initial datasets, see
:ref:`getting-started`. For the actual analyses and corresponding results
(Figures/Tables), see :ref:`analysis-notebooks`.
