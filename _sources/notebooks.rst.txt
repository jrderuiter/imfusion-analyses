Analysis notebooks
==================

Our analyses and results are described in several Jupyter notebooks, which can
be used to generate most of the Figures and Tables in the paper. The analyses
are divided into the following notebooks:

1. `SB - Analysis <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/1.%20SB%20-%20Analysis.ipynb>`_
2. `SB - ShearSplink comparison <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/2.%20SB%20-%20ShearSplink%20comparison.ipynb>`_
3. `Sanger - DNAseq comparison <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/3.%20Sanger%20-%20DNAseq%20comparison.ipynb>`_
4. `Sanger - Subsampling <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/4.%20Sanger%20-%20Subsampling.ipynb>`_
5. `Sanger - Single vs paired-end <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/5.%20Sanger%20-%20Single%20vs.%20paired-end.ipynb>`_
6. `Sanger - Fusion finder <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/6.%20Sanger%20-%20Fusion%20finder.ipynb>`_
7. `STAR-Fusion <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/7.%20STAR-fusion.ipynb>`_
8. `SB - Transcript Instability <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/8.%20SB%20-%20Transcript%20instability.ipynb>`_

With the following appendices:

A. `Supplementary tables <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/A.%20Supplementary%20tables.ipynb>`_
B. `Alignment statistics <https://github.com/jrderuiter/imfusion-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/B.%20Alignment%20statistics.ipynb>`_

In general, each notebook describes the analysis for a single set
of results. Appendix notebook A contains code for generating the Supplemental
Tables that are not part of any other notebooks. Appendix notebook B contains
the code used for generating alignment statistics of the two datasets.

Static versions of the notebooks can be viewed in the GitHub repository_.
