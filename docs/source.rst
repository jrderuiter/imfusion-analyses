===========

The notebooks and other source code are available on GitHub_. This includes
the pre-processing pipelines and data files required to reproduce the
RNA-seq and insertion analyses.

The repository has the following structure:

The main analyses are described in the Jupyter notebooks. Supporting code
is provided in the *nbsupport* module under the *src* directory. Figures/Tables
generated by the notebooks are stored in the appropriate location under the
*reports* directory.
